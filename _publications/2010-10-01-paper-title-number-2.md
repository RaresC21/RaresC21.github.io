In many real-world applications, predictive methods are used to provide inputs for downstream optimization problems. It has been shown that using the downstream task-based objective to learn the intermediate predictive model is often better than using only intermediate task objectives, such as prediction error. The difficulty in end-to-end learning lies in differentiating through the optimization problem. Therefore, we propose a neural network architecture that can learn to approximately solve these optimization problems, particularly ensuring its output satisfies the feasibility constraints via alternate projections.

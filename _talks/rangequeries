We consider a common class of database range queries which consists of evaluating a given function on contiguous subranges of arrays. 
For instance, this may be the average or minimum of a range. Such queries are also common subroutines in various algorithms. 
A common approach to tackling the range query problem for semigroup operators is to precompute the answer for a small subset of ranges, and combine these solutions when answering any given query. For instance, the sum of the elements from index i to index j can be computed as the answers to the ranges from i to k and k+1 to j for i <= k < j. 
This introduces an inherent tradeoff between the precomputation complexity and the query complexity - the more precomputation, 
the less query time required. Moreover, we consider a data-driven case and design a method to make better precompuation decisions than traditional methods.
